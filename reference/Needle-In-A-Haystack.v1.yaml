  title: Needle In A Haystack

  description: |-
    This API has a method called findNeedles() that searches though a sentence String called a "haystack" and looks for specified keywords called "needles" and outputs a count of how times each of those keywords appear in that sentence.

    Here is the Java Method:

    ```java
    public static void findNeedles(String haystack, String[] needles) {
        if (needles.length > 5) {
            System.err.println("Too many words!");
        } else {
            int[] countArray = new int[needles.length];
            for (int i = 0; i < needles.length; i++) {
                String[] words = haystack.split("[ \"\'\t\n\b\f\r]", 0);

                //Check for a comma at the end of a String element in array words and 
                //remove that Character from that String element.
                for (int wc = 0; wc < words.length; wc++) {
                    if(words[wc].contains(",")){
                        //Remove that comma at the end.
                        words[wc] = words[wc].substring(0, words[wc].length() -1);
                    }
                    else {
                        //do nothing
                    }
                }

                //Check for a period at the end of a String element in array words and 
                //remove that Character from that String element.
                for (int wp = 0; wp < words.length; wp++) {
                    if(words[wp].contains(".")){
                        //Remove that period at the end.
                        words[wp] = words[wp].substring(0, words[wp].length() -1);
                    }
                    else {
                        //do nothing
                    }
                }

                for (int j = 0; j < words.length; j++) {
                    if (words[j].compareToIgnoreCase(needles[i]) == 0) {
                        countArray[i]++;
                    }
                }
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < needles.length; j++) {
                System.out.println(needles[j] + ": " + countArray[j]);
            }
        }
    }
    ```
